History[edit]
Background[edit]
The MP3 lossy audio-data compression algorithm takes advantage of a perceptual limitation of human hearing called auditory masking. In 1894, the American physicist Alfred M. Mayer reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency.[19] In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon.[20] Between 1967 and 1974, Eberhard Zwicker did work in the areas of tuning and masking of critical frequency-bands,[21][22] which in turn built on the fundamental research in the area from Harvey Fletcher and his collaborators at Bell Labs.[23]

Perceptual coding was first used for speech coding compression with linear predictive coding (LPC),[24] which has origins in the work of Fumitada Itakura (Nagoya University) and Shuzo Saito (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) in 1966.[25] In 1978, Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs proposed an LPC speech codec, called adaptive predictive coding, that used a psychoacoustic coding-algorithm exploiting the masking properties of the human ear.[24][26] Further optimisation by Schroeder and Atal with J.L. Hall was later reported in a 1979 paper.[27] That same year, a psychoacoustic masking codec was also proposed by M. A. Krasner,[28] who published and produced hardware for speech (not usable as music bit-compression), but the publication of his results in a relatively obscure Lincoln Laboratory Technical Report[29] did not immediately influence the mainstream of psychoacoustic codec-development.

The discrete cosine transform (DCT), a type of transform coding for lossy compression, proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, was developed by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1973; they published their results in 1974.[30][31][32] This led to the development of the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), proposed by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley in 1987,[33] following earlier work by Princen and Bradley in 1986.[34] The MDCT later became a core part of the MP3 algorithm.[35]

Ernst Terhardt and other collaborators constructed an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy in 1982.[36] This work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to Fletcher, and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and critical bandwidths.

In 1985, Atal and Schroeder presented code-excited linear prediction (CELP), an LPC-based perceptual speech-coding algorithm with auditory masking that achieved a significant data compression ratio for its time.[24] IEEE's refereed Journal on Selected Areas in Communications reported on a wide variety of (mostly perceptual) audio compression algorithms in 1988.[37] The "Voice Coding for Communications" edition published in February 1988 reported on a wide range of established, working audio bit compression technologies,[37] some of them using auditory masking as part of their fundamental design, and several showing real-time hardware implementations.
