Title: Using XML to Interpret Data Returned by Web Services

Overview: This article discusses how to interpret data returned by web services using XML. It explains how XML represents data, the syntax rules of XML, and how to access images from the web using URLs. The article also introduces the DOM approach to parsing XML, and gives an example of a program that pulls URLs from an XML file.

Highlights:
- XML represents data by wrapping it with tags nested according to their relationships to one another.
- A tag can have a set of name-value attributes that give particular details.
- To interpret data returned by a web service we have to know how to interpret the tags and their relationships to each other.
- The syntax of XML requires all tags to be enclosed with angle brackets and come in properly nested pairs.
- Java provides numerous XML parsing libraries; the DOM approach is one of them.
- The DOM gives us the ability to search for elements with a specific tag name and get their attributes.
- The Flickr API documentation describes the format for different types of queries.
- We can access an image with a URL of this form: http://farm{farm-id}.staticflickr.com/{server-id}/{id}_{secret}.jpg.
- The article includes an example of a program that pulls URLs from an XML file.
