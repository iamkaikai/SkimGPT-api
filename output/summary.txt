- XML is a markup language that uses a hierarchical structure to represent data.
- XML is widely used in data exchange between different systems, as it allows for easy parsing and interpretation by different programming languages.
- In CS 10 programming, XML processing can be done using tools like DOM and SAX parsers.
- DOM (Document Object Model) parser creates an in-memory representation of the XML document and allows for easy manipulation of individual elements.
- SAX (Simple API for XML) parser is an event-driven approach that reads the XML document sequentially and triggers events for each element encountered. SAX parser is faster and requires less memory compared to DOM parser.
- XML processing can also involve transformations using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), which allows for converting XML data to different formats like HTML, PDF, or CSV.
