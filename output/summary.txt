Overview: In this section, we will discuss web services and the usage of REST mechanism in retrieving information. The REST, REpresentational State Transfer, is a powerful mechanism that is built directly on top of the HTTP approach used for web pages. 

Highlights:

- We will be dealing with web services and information delivered via the same machinery.
- We will use REST, a basic but powerful and common mechanism built on top of the same HTTP approach we used for web pages.
- Multiple parameters can be included in the URL, separated by ampersands.
- A more powerful approach is to leverage the "post" mechanism for sending form data.
- We need to "URL encode" the parameter values using an encoding of such "special characters".


Title: Graphical User Interface in CS 10 – Overview and Highlights

Overview:
One of the most important topics in CS 10 is learning about graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs are essential for building user-friendly software that allows users to interact with computers and other digital devices.

Title: An Introduction to Network Programming and HTTP

Overview: This article provides an overview of network programming and the HTTP protocol used in web-based communication. It explains how information is transferred between computers, how bits are interpreted, network protocols, and HTTP. The article also includes a code example in Java for getting a webpage from a web server.

Highlights:

- Network programming is about transferring information between computers in the right way.
- Computers deal with bits, and network protocols are used to interpret incoming bits and send outgoing bits appropriately.
- HTTP is a set of rules for how web browsers and servers communicate with each other.
- The URL is the global identity of the webpage you want to access.
- Java libraries provide an easy way to access web servers within a program.
- The Reader/Stream mechanism for reading data from a URL works similarly to reading data from files.
- Exception handling is required when opening and reading from URLs due to potential errors.


Title: Introduction to XML and Parsing with Java

Overview: This article explores approaches to encoding data in a way that a program can interpret, including the use of eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML represents data by wrapping it with tags and nested tags can represent components of the outer parts. We will focus on a Flickr-based photo search application and build a program to pull down URLs from an XML file.

Highlights:
- XML is related to HTML and represents data by wrapping it with tags
- Tags can be nested and have name-value attributes that give particular details
- Properly nested tag pairs are required, and self-closing tags are used when there's nothing to be nested inside
- XML parsing with Java's document object model (DOM) approach can directly build a document structure mirroring the nested structure in an XML file
- The DOM allows us to search for elements with a specific tag name and get their attributes, making it possible to find and extract relevant data from an XML file.

Title: FlickrSearch.java - A Utility to Fetch Images from Flickr API

Overview: FlickrSearch.java is an optimal tool that combines various features like XML parsing, construction and execution of queries, URL encoding, and Java Image mechanism to pull images from Flickr API and store them in an array. The article includes the following highlights:

- loadImages is the core function that helps in fetching images from URLs in the XML.
- The application constructs and executes the query by specifying various parameters like "text," "sort," etc., as given in the photo search docs of Flickr. 
- Image URLs are formed using a specific technique discussed earlier in the article. "z" at the end of the URLs denotes images with a maximum size of 640 pixels on one side.
- Users need to obtain an API key from Flickr to run this utility. The article provides a final variable of the API key on canvas.
- Users should only use this application for appropriate searches and keep usage simple.

Paragraph:

FlickrSearch.java is a powerful utility to fetch images from the Flickr API. The article's core function, loadImages, is similar to ProcessXML.java's code and fetches images from URLs in the XML by constructing and executing the specified query. Image URLs are formed using a specific technique, specifying "z" at the end of the URL for images with a maximum size of 640 pixels on one side. Use of this application requires an API key from Flickr, with the final variable of the API key provided on canvas. Keep usage to appropriate and simple searches only.
