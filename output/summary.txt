Additionally, anonymous classes can be created without giving them a name, and can use the variables and methods of the outer class.

Highlights:
- Inner classes can be defined inside other classes for information hiding and locality
- Inner classes have direct access to the outer class variables and methods
- Anonymous classes can be created without a name, but use the outer class' variables and methods
- Both inner and anonymous classes are useful for encapsulation and organizing code

It also discusses the use of encoding classes for output parameters, and the difference in using "get" and "post" methods.

Highlights:
- REST is a powerful mechanism for exchanging information between server and client
- REST directly uses the "get" machinery to fetch web pages and output results
- Multiple input parameters for REST services can be included, separated by ampersands
- "Post" machinery is another approach for sending data to the server but is more complicated
- Spaces and special characters in parameter values need to be encoded using classes such as URLEncoder.
